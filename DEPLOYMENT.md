# Deployment

The repository supports two Vercel projects from the same `main` branch.

## Student Project

- Root directory: `./`
- Install command: `npm ci`
- Build command: `npm run build:vercel`
- Output directory: `.next`

Environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `STUDENT_SESSION_SECRET`

Do not set `LMS_APP_TARGET` for the student project. It defaults to `student`.

Before enabling the new private access login in production, apply:

- `supabase/migrations/20260701183000_student_access_device_sessions.sql`

## Admin Project

- Root directory: `./`
- Install command: `npm ci`
- Build command: `npm run build:vercel`
